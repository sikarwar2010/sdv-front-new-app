/**
 * domain.ts — the canonical dropdown options, enums and status maps used by
 * the web forms and tables.
 *
 * CRITICAL: these are RE-EXPORTED from the shared backend modules under
 * `@convex/*`, never hand-redefined. The mobile app and the Convex validators
 * import the same constants, so a value that renders in a <Select> here is
 * guaranteed to pass `validateTaxationSection` / `validateServicesSection` /
 * `validateFloorRow` on the server. If a category is ever edited in the
 * backend, this file picks it up with zero drift.
 *
 * At runtime the live, admin-editable option sets come from `masters.bundle`
 * (use the `useMasters()` hook). These static exports are the typed fallback /
 * the source for zod enums where the backend treats the field as a closed set.
